/*
on line 1 we declare a global variable num and intialize it to a number 5.
On line 3 - 5 we define a for loop with an index of 1 and increment by 
1 after each iteration until reaching it's conditon which is 5 since the global variable num
is intialize to 5. finally on line 4 console.log is called with value of `i` to the console
which outputs 1,2,3,4,5.
